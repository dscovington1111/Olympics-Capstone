## *Identifying The Top Sport Of The Summer Olympic Games And Team USA's Performance* 

# MOTIVATION 

The Summer Olympic Games is a time full of excitement, anticipation, and individuals expressing 
their nation's pride. I have always enjoyed watching the Summer Olympic Games since my childhood. 
Millions of onlookers witness records being broken and events coming down to the last millisecond, 
point, or even inch. I'm intrigued to uncover how well Team USA held its own in the Summer 
Olympic Games over time.

# Executive Summary

My capstone project consists of analysis on Team USA during the Summer Olympic Games from 
1984-2016. The primary areas of focus are on the top sport by total medals awarded, how well 
Team USA excels in this area, who are the top athletes of this sport, and any trends discovered. 
The United States is known to be successful in track & field, swimming, gymnastics, and other 
sports, but which one of these sports are awarded the most medals? My hope is to shed light on 
Team USA's performance history and how they have proved themselves as a major Olympic contender. 
The current assumption is the swimming and athletics sports are the most medal awarded sports. 

# DATA QUESTION

From 1984-2016, where does Team USA shine the most compared to other competing nations and who 
are the top athletic performers in these areas?

# MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT 

My final analysis will encompass charts that demonstrates comparisons between the top overall 
sport with most medals awarded, top performers of this sport, and trend of medals earned by 
the top performing countries over time. I'll discuss whether GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per 
capita plays a role in the medals earned and if life expectancy affects the medals won using 
an interactive dashboard. My hope for this project is to deliver additional information about 
how Team USA proved themselves as a respectable competitor and which individuals are the driving 
force for the team's overall success.
